J-SHOUT is a shout box. A shout box is a form on a web page that users can post comments to that is always available and publicly (or privately) viewable.

J-SHOUT requires the users are authenticated before they are allowed to post to the shout box, this helps reduce certain types of spamming in the shout box.

Using multiple languages, J-SHOUT is updated in real time, not 10 seconds ago, right now. This is made possible by jQuery and PHP. The shouts are stored in a MySQL database and shown in the shout box for the world to see. 

We have added many features to J-SHOUT including switches that the user can type that will cause different actions within the shout box. Some of the switches will allow users to do certain things such as log-in or register. Other switches will allow the user to ping, private shout, and other options that you would expect from a great shout box. 

You can also integrate your J-SHOUT shout box with your current website and authentication methods. This does however, require editing code within J-SHOUT. If you're not comfortable doing this, or don't have access to a developer who can assist you please let us know by leaving a comment at the bottom of the page or by contacting jshout@cloudink.info.
